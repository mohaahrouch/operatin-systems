# Operating System

## Overview

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. The OS acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, ensuring efficient resource management and providing a user-friendly environment.

## Features

* **Process Management:** Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
* **Memory Management:** Manages the allocation and deallocation of memory spaces.
* **File System:** Organizes and controls data storage on physical drives.
* **Device Management:** Controls and coordinates peripheral devices.
* **Security and Access Control:** Ensures authorized access to system resources.
* **User Interface:** Provides command-line or graphical interfaces for user interaction.
* **Multitasking:** Allows multiple applications to run simultaneously.

---

## Architecture

The OS architecture typically consists of the following components:

* **Kernel:** Core component managing system resources and communication between hardware and software.
* **Shell:** User interface for interacting with the kernel via commands.
* **File System:** Manages data storage and retrieval.
* **Device Drivers:** Interface between hardware devices and the OS.
* **System Libraries:** Provide essential APIs for application development.

## How It Works

1. **Booting:** The system initializes hardware and loads the kernel.
2. **Process Scheduling:** The OS allocates CPU time among active processes.
3. **Memory Allocation:** Assigns memory space to processes.
4. **Input/Output Handling:** Manages data exchange between devices and software.
5. **File Operations:** Facilitates creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.
6. **User Management:** Controls user permissions and access rights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Compatible hardware (specify architecture if necessary)
* Development tools (compiler, assembler, linker, etc.)
* Bootloader (if applicable)

### Installation

Provide instructions on how to install or build the OS, e.g.:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohaahrouch/Operating-systems.git
cd your-os
make
```

---

## Usage

Explain how to run or test the OS, e.g.,

* Running in a virtual machine (QEMU, VirtualBox)
* Installing on actual hardware
* Using shell commands
